# Introduction to Software Design

This syllabus emphasizes the art of designing software by leveraging UML, use-cases, and design patterns. It equips you with the skills to formulate solutions for common problems by analyzing patterns. A proficient designer understands both the developer's actions and the business user's requirements to construct a comprehensive model. Modeling involves creating graphical representations such as UML, serving as a guide for subsequent implementation. UML, being an open standard, is instrumental in describing object-oriented models, addressing vital aspects of software modifiability, adaptation, and evolution.

Throughout this semester, you'll delve into the creation of graphical models and their application to real-life problems through assignments. The modeling process encompasses static and dynamic modeling techniques, offering a holistic view of the software structure. Software architectural design, often referred to as high-level design, lays the foundation for detailed design.
