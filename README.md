# Introduction to Software Design

This syllabus focuses on designing software with modeling UML, use-cases, and patterns. It teaches how to create a solution to some common set of problems created while analyzing patterns. A designer needs to understand what the developer will do and also know what the user (business) wants to design a model. Modeling is to build a graphical model like UML, which is used to direct the subsequent implementation. UML is a standard language. This standard does not mean unchanged. It can be "Open standard" (look this up). UML is used to describe object-oriented models, a concept that addresses fundamental issues of software modifiability, adaptation, and evolution.

In this semester, you will learn how to create graphical modeling and apply it to a real-life problem as an assignment. Modeling requires using static modeling and dynamic modeling to describe the whole structure. Software architectural design is referred to as high-level design, which is the starting point for the detailed design.
